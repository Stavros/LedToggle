# LedToggle

An example for NIOS II processor to toggle a Led with a Button

## Information

This is a VHDL project for DSD-I1* a Cyclone IV FPGA built in Quartus 18.1 to design a NIOS II processor block and execute C code to toggle Led with the push of a Button. You can change the predefined pins assigned to Led (PIN_110) and Button (PIN_51) using the Pin Planner.
